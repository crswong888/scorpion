# NOTE: Unit tests require the cppunit library, which is provided by the 'libcppunit-dev' package.
#       For this script to work, you must first run the following commands:
#           ```
#           cd ~/.cppunit
#           ./link_installation.sh
#           ```
#       The script assumes the default installation directory for Debian systems, so be careful!
#
# NOTE: To run an individual libmesh example after compiling, navigate to the examples directory
#       and build/test it with `make check -j4`. Then it can be ran using the binary like:
#           `./example-opt <input arguments>`
#       or in parallel like:
#           `mpiexex -np 2 ./example-opt <input arguments> --n-threads=2`.
#
# NOTE: You can run individual tests for `make check` in parallel like:
#           `LIBMESH_RUN="mpiexec -np 2" LIBMESH_OPTIONS="--n_threads=2" make check -j4`
#
# NOTE: If you edit the LibMesh source (i.e., not simply the example file), you have to recompile
#       in the root directory with `make -j4` before running `make check` on an example executable.
#       You can also simply rebuild a binary without testing or recompiling in the root like:
#           `make example-opt -j4`
#
# NOTE: Run libMesh unit tests like:
#           ```
#           cd tests
#           ./unit_tests-opt
#           ```
#       use a regex to specify an individual CPPUNIT_TEST() to run like:
#           `./unit_tests-devel --re MeshInputTest::testExodusCopyElementSolutionReplicated`
#       or a group of them like:
#           `./unit_tests-devel --re MeshInputTest`
#
# NOTE: If you modify unit tests, the 'devel' binary must be recompiled in the 'tests' directory
#       with `make -j4` ('opt' is recompiled with `make check -j4` or `make unit_tests-opt -j4`)
#
# For more information, simply run `make -h`
