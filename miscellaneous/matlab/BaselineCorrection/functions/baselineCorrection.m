%%% This function applies a baseline correction (BLC) to a discrete-time acceleration signal 'accel'
%%% specified at an array of time instants 'time'. It is based on the type-oriented algorithm (TOA)
%%% developed by Christopher J. Wong at the University of Utah.
%%%
%%% Baseline drift is a phenomena caused by double-integration of an acceleration time history with
%%% initial conditions that are inconsistent with a particle that vibrates in-place (i.e., about a
%%% constant baseline), especially when the homogenous initial value problem is assumed, which is
%%% the one assumed here. That is, assuming that the particle is initially at rest may not be an
%%% appropriate assumption for a given acceleration if the expectation is in-place vibration.
%%% However, this assumption can be maintained by applying a BLC to compensate for drifting.
%%%
%%% The traditional methodology for BLC involves subtracting a least squares polynomial from the
%%% nominal (uncorrected) time series', which is effective at removing drift while preserving the
%%% important properties of the nominal signal, such as frequency and relative amplitudes. The TOA
%%% employs this approach, but the corrections are based on permutations of the three kinematic
%%% variables (acceleration, velocity, and displacement) adjusted in sequence. Each adjustment can
%%% be of a different polynomial degree, and very high orders are achievable by preconditioning the
%%% least squares system of equations (normal equations) using lower-upper (LU) factorization.
%%%
%%% The TOA provides its user with basic "correction types," for which there are seven denoted by: 
%%% A, AV, AD, AVD, V, VD, and D. The characters A, V, and D represent the adjustments made to
%%% accelerations, velocities, and displacements, respectively. The user specifies which basic type
%%% to apply by providing inputs for the parameters 'AccelFitOrder', 'VelFitOrder', and
%%% 'DispFitOrder'. For example, if a user invokes this function with 'AccelFitOrder', 4,
%%% 'DispFitOrder', 2, this would be a type AD correction or, more specifically, a type A4D2. Some 
%%% of the most common types provided by popular commercial software are A3 or V3 corrections. For 
%%% most acceleration signals, the common ones will be an appropriate compensation for drift. 
%%% However, signals with poor frequency content, like a trigonometric polynomial, require stronger 
%%% corrections, e.g., type A13V13D11.
%%%
%%% When selecting a correction type, it is recommended that the order be less than the number of
%%% periods elapsed in the signal, and that the order be equal or decrease through the sequence,
%%% i.e., 'AccelFitOrder' >= 'VelFitOrder' >= 'DispFitOrder'. It is also recommended that the drift
%%% ratio 'DR' and amplitude ratio 'AR' satisfy certain constraints: After performing a BLC using
%%% this function, invoke the 'computeDriftRatio()' function included in this package and check that 
%%% 'DR < 0.05' and '|AR - 1| < 0.05' is satisfied. If not, then try a different correction type.
