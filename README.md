## SCORPION

- This repository is developed by: Christopher J. Wong (crsong888@gmail.com)

This repository was originally created in support of [NEUP Project 17-12939: Expansion of BISON Capabilities to Predict the Dynamic Response of Irradiated Fuel Rods](https://neup.inl.gov/Lists/Awards/DispForm.aspx?ID=593&Source=https%3A%2F%2Fneup%2Einl%2Egov%2FSitePages%2FFY17_RandD_Awards%2Easpx&ContentTypeId=0x01000FF41AD33234E04B888509DF4B53DDA9). It was intended to be the custom [MOOSE](https://mooseframework.inl.gov/) application used for prototyping/testing/demonstration of the various components of the project. However, it has grown into a giant mess and this is no longer its primary purpose.

Nowadays, I (@crswong888) mostly just use this as cloud storage and general revision control for various projects I am working on. It is still a MOOSE application at its root, but none of the custom MOOSE objects are guaranteed to work nor are any of the input files in the `input/` directory (although most should). Furthermore, I have all kinds of stuff going on in the `miscellaneous/` directory. For example, I manage several of my personal [MathWorks FEX](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) packages in there.
