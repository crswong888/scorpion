The main purpose of this application is to develop prototype MOOSE
objects as well as to conduct various tests on the current capabilities 
of the Framework in regards to its numerical efficacy to solve structural 
dynamics problems.

=========================================================================
NO TESTS FOR THE BISON NUCLEAR FUEL PERFORMANCE CODE ARE CONDUCTED USING
THIS APPLICATION, NOR IS THERE ANY INFORMATION WHATSOEVER REGARDING THE
BISON SOURCE CODE STORED ON THIS REPOSITORY.
